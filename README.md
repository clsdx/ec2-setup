setup.git
=========
Download and run this on a new EC2 instance running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to
configure both the machine and your individual development environment as
follows:

```sh
wget -qO- https://github.com/clsdx/ec2-setup/raw/master/setup.sh | sh
```

Note: You will probably need to exit and reconnect to apply the new .bash_profile.
